This repository contains a collection of Python projects and scripts I've developed, showcasing my skills in backend development, GUI programming, and object-oriented principles. The projects in this repository demonstrate practical applications of Python in areas such as:

News Application: A GUI-based app that fetches and reads live news using Python and Tkinter.
Weather Application: A Python application that displays real-time weather data with a simple user interface.
Stone Paper Scissors Game: An interactive game where users can play against a computer bot, built using Python logic.
Each project illustrates different concepts in Python, such as API integration, GUI development, and OOPs. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or offer feedback!
